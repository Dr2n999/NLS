[["closing-remarks.html", "Closing Remarks", " Closing Remarks In my experience in bioanalytical research, particularly when working with complex data from ligand binding assays or other experimental methods, I’ve found that having a solid understanding of the mathematical principles behind the tools we use is absolutely crucial. However, I’ve noticed that many bioanalytical scientists, including myself in the past, often rely on established functions or commercial software without fully grasping the underlying mathematical details of the algorithms, simply because there aren’t enough opportunities to learn these principles. This, I’ve realized, can limit our ability and creativity. One of my primary goals has been to provide a clearer and more transparent understanding of the mathematical principles behind non-linear regression. I’ve found that this transparency not only deepens my own understanding but also benefits others who encounter similar challenges. I hope my work fosters a deeper appreciation of the process, ultimately leading to significant improvements in the quality of our work. "]]
